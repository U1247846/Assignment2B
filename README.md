# Assignment2

I have created two new repositories for assignment 2, one for part A (where we are required to write a Latex-file and turn it into HTML with pandoc) and one for part B (where we need to make a HTML-presentation). The links to the HTML-page of part A and the HTML-presentation of part B are as follows:

Link to html-page: http://u1247846.github.io/Assignment2A

Link to html-presentation: http://u1247846.github.io/Assignment2B

As I already indicated by e-mail, I initially designed my Latex-file with pdf output in mind, see the file Latex_Test_PDF.tex and accompanying pdf-output Latex_Test.pdf on the gh-pages branch of the 2A-repo. In order to improve the layout somewhat for html, I altered some commands, ending up with Latex_Test_HTML.tex which forms the basis for the index.html file on the gh-pages branch of the 2A-repo. However, in my view the html output is still very sloppy, so please with respect to the layout consider the pdf file first and foremost, as that is the main layout I intended while writing my Latex-file.

The HTML-presentation is adapted from the Latex-file. The markdown file underlying the presentation (as well as the HTML file itself) can be found in the 2B-repo.
